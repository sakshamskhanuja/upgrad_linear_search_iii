## Linear Search

### Description

Write a code that returns the number of unsuccessful attempts made to search for an element in the array using linear search.

The code should:

<ul>
<li>Take the size of the array as an input from the user</li>
<li>The elements of the array as an input from the user</li>
<li>The key you are searching for as an input from the user</li>
</ul>

### Sample Input

20<br>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20<br>
21

### Sample Output

20

So in this sample test case, the first input is the size of the array i.e the array has 20 elements. Next 20 inputs are the elements inside the array. Since in this case, it will take 20 unsuccessful steps (comparing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 with 21) for the code to reach the conclusion that 21 does not exist in the array. Thus the output will be 20.
